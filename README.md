# GraphWizard
A simple window-based application to perform Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s algorithm,  and Dijkstra’s algorithm in a data set.  The resulting graph is displayed using NetworkX and matplotlib libraries. Input can be from a manual text entry window or from a file.
To use you must install NetworkX.  See https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/install.html
Test files are test1.txt, test2.txt, and test3-dijkstra.txt (for that algorithm only). See instructions in program for details on manual entry of a data set.
